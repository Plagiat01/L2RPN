## L2RPN

This my participation to the challenge [L2RPN NEURIPS 2020 - Adaptability Track](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/25427#participate-submit_results).

It is implementing a Deep Q-Learning algorithm.

You can download a pretrained model on 2000 episodes
[here](https://mega.nz/folder/vdtEQaQS#RXFizR2CiqcyAKQys76fgA).
(Create a subfolder named `DQN_NN` the folder `submission`
and place the files `main.h5` and `parameters.json` in it.)
