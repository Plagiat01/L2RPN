## L2RPN

This my participation to the challenge [L2RPN NEURIPS 2020 - Adaptability Track](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/25427#participate-submit_results).

It is implementing a Deep Q-Learning algorithm. You can download a pretrained model on 1000 episodes [here](https://mega.nz/file/uZ8UQbKQ#B6ojAjz1qP59SspTpEsFLiKaRuBjUCReVpxXhWq3Yw8).
